# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
Ethereum Smart Contract Implementation

As part of this thesis, an Ethereum-based prototype was developed to automate and secure the e-waste recovery process using smart contracts.

Features:

Smart Contracts in Solidity for enforcing recovery rules and automating process adaptation.

Immutable Tracking of recovery steps on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and accountability.

Decentralized Workflow allowing stakeholders (producers, recyclers, regulators) to interact without central control.

Automated Adaptation where recovery tasks are triggered based on predefined conditions.

Tools & Tech:

Ethereum Blockchain

Solidity (Smart Contract Development)

Hardhat (Testing & Deployment)

MetaMask & Ganache (Wallet + Local Blockchain Simulation)
